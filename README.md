337. **Griefing with Dust Loans** - Bypass minLoanSize checks to force small loans that waste gas

## NEWLY ADDED: Liquidation Incentive Vulnerability Vectors

### **Category Overview**
These attacks exploit weaknesses in liquidation incentive mechanisms, making liquidations unprofitable or impossible. This can lead to protocol insolvency and accumulation of bad debt.

### **Attack Vectors**
338. **No Liquidation Incentive Attack** - Liquidate without sufficient rewards, making liquidation unprofitable
339. **No Incentive for Small Positions** - Create small position below gas cost threshold, preventing liquidation
340. **Profitable User Withdraws All Collateral** - User with positive PNL withdraws all collateral, leaving no incentive

342. **Partial Liquidation Bypasses Bad Debt** - Avoid covering bad debt via partial liquidation
343. **No Partial Liquidation Prevents Whale Liquidation** - Large position exceeds individual liquidator capacity

## NEWLY ADDED: Liquidation Denial of Service Vulnerability Vectors

### **Category Overview**
These attacks prevent liquidations from occurring through various DoS techniques and state manipulation. They can make the protocol unusable and allow unhealthy positions to remain active.

### **Attack Vectors**
344. **Many Small Positions DoS Attack** - Create many small positions to cause OOG revert during liquidation
345. **Multiple Positions Corruption** - Corrupt EnumerableSet ordering to prevent liquidation
346. **Front-Run Prevention Attack** - Change nonce or perform small self-liquidation to block liquidation
347. **Pending Action Prevention** - Pending withdrawals equal to balance force liquidation reverts
348. **Malicious Callback Prevention** - onERC721Received or ERC20 hooks revert during liquidation
349. **Yield Vault Collateral Hiding** - Hide collateral in external vaults during liquidation
350. **Insurance Fund Insufficient** - Bad debt exceeding insurance fund prevents liquidation
351. **Fixed Bonus Insufficient Collateral** - 110% bonus fails when collateral ratio < 110%
352. **Non-18 Decimal Reverts** - Incorrect decimal handling causes liquidation failure
353. **Multiple NonReentrant Modifiers** - Complex liquidation paths hit multiple reentrancy guards
354. **Zero Value Transfer Reverts** - Missing zero checks with tokens that revert on zero transfer
355. **Token Deny List Reverts** - USDC-style blocklists prevent liquidation token transfers
356. **Single Borrower Edge Case** - Protocol incorrectly assumes > 1 borrower for liquidation

## NEWLY ADDED: Liquidation Calculation Vulnerability Vectors

### **Category Overview**
These attacks exploit mathematical errors and precision issues in liquidation calculations. They can lead to incorrect rewards, unfair fees, and economic inefficiencies.

### **Attack Vectors**
357. **Incorrect Liquidator Reward** - Decimal precision errors make rewards too small/large
358. **Unprioritized Liquidator Reward** - Other fees paid first, removing liquidation incentive
359. **Excessive Protocol Fee** - 30%+ fees on seized collateral make liquidation unprofitable
360. **Missing Liquidation Fees in Requirements** - Minimum collateral doesn't account for liquidation costs
361. **Unaccounted Yield/PNL** - Earned yield or positive PNL not included in collateral value
362. **No Swap Fee During Liquidation** - Protocol loses fees when liquidation involves swaps
363. **Oracle Sandwich Self-Liquidation** - Users trigger price updates for profitable self-liquidation

## NEWLY ADDED: Unfair Liquidation Vulnerability Vectors

### **Category Overview**
These attacks create unfair liquidation scenarios that harm users or benefit attackers. They exploit timing issues, state inconsistencies, and protocol design flaws.

### **Attack Vectors**
364. **Missing L2 Sequencer Grace Period** - Users liquidated immediately when sequencer restarts
365. **Interest Accumulates While Paused** - Users liquidated for interest accrued during pause
366. **Repayment Paused, Liquidation Active** - Users prevented from avoiding liquidation
367. **Late Interest/Fee Updates** - isLiquidatable checks stale values
368. **Lost Positive PNL/Yield** - Profitable positions lose gains during liquidation
369. **Unhealthier Post-Liquidation State** - Liquidator cherry-picks stable collateral
370. **Corrupted Collateral Priority** - Liquidation order doesn't match risk profile
371. **Borrower Replacement Misattribution** - Original borrower repays new owner's debt
372. **No LTV Gap** - Users liquidatable immediately after borrowing
373. **Interest During Auction** - Borrowers accrue interest while being auctioned
374. **No Liquidation Slippage Protection** - Liquidators can't specify minimum acceptable rewards

## NEWLY ADDED: Staking & Reward Vulnerability Vectors

### **Category Overview**
These attacks target staking protocols and reward distribution mechanisms. They can lead to unfair reward distribution, precision loss, and economic manipulation.

### **Attack Vectors**
375. **Front-Running First Deposit** - Attacker steals initial WETH rewards via sandwich attack
376. **Reward Dilution via Direct Transfer** - Sending tokens directly increases totalSupply without staking
377. **Precision Loss in Reward Calculation** - Small stakes or frequent updates cause rewards to round to zero
378. **Flash Deposit/Withdraw Griefing** - Large instant deposits dilute rewards for existing stakers
379. **Update Not Called After Reward Distribution** - Stale index causes incorrect reward calculations
380. **Balance Caching Issues** - Claiming updates cached balance incorrectly

## NEWLY ADDED: Auction Manipulation Vulnerability Vectors

### **Category Overview**
These attacks manipulate auction mechanisms for unfair advantage. They can lead to auction manipulation, unfair timing, and protocol exploitation.

### **Attack Vectors**
381. **Self-Bidding to Reset Auction** - Buying own loan to restart auction timer
382. **Auction Start During Sequencer Downtime** - L2 sequencer issues affect auction timing
383. **Insufficient Auction Length Validation** - Very short auctions (1 second) allow immediate seizure
384. **Auction Can Be Seized During Active Period** - Off-by-one error in timestamp check

## NEWLY ADDED: Concentrated Liquidity Manager Vulnerability Vectors

### **Category Overview**
These attacks target concentrated liquidity protocols and TWAP mechanisms. They can lead to unfavorable liquidity deployment, rug pulls, and token loss.

### **Attack Vectors**
385. **Forced Unfavorable Liquidity Deployment** - Missing TWAP checks allow draining via sandwich attacks
386. **Owner Rug-Pull via TWAP Parameters** - Setting ineffective maxDeviation/twapInterval disables protection
387. **Tokens Permanently Stuck** - Rounding errors accumulate tokens that can never be withdrawn
388. **Stale Token Approvals** - Router updates don't revoke previous approvals
389. **Retrospective Fee Application** - Updated fees apply to previously earned rewards
